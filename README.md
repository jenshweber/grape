# GrapeVine

**_GrapeVine_** is a functional **G**raph **R**ewriting and **P**ersistence **E**ngine for Clojure.  _**GrapeVine**_ can be used with or without the integrated computational notebook (called _**GrapePress**_). 

**_GrapeVine_** is a fundamentally new release of _Grape_ and _GrapePress_ with the difference that **_GrapeVine_** empraces functional graph transformations, while  _Grape_ and _GrapePress_ used stateful computation. (If you are looking for the old _Grape_ / _GrapePress_ please swith to branch "grape-legacy".)

# Installation

## Quickstart - for users

If you are merely interested _using_ the **_GrapeVine_** notebook, simply clone the [starter project](https://github.com/jenshweber/grapepress-starter) (which uses Docker). 

## For developers

If you want to contribute to the **_GrapeVine_** code, clone this repo and look at the Wiki for info on how to get going.

# Tutorial

_GrapeVine_ comes with an "executable" tutorial worksheet in the "help" directory. Simply load it by hitting control-g control-l.

Here is a [read-only version of the tutorial](https://web.uvic.ca/~jens/gv/view.html?source=github&user=jenshweber&repo=grape&path=help/tutorial.clj)
